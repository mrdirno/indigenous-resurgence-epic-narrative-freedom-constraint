## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character 'listens' to a non-human entity (a river, a forest, a mountain) and learns a story that contradicts the official record.
- Create a monologue for a Keeper of the Archive, justifying why containment is a form of preservation and freedom is chaos.
- Imagine a 'glitch' in the Archive—a story that refuses to be categorized or still speaks. Describe its manifestation and what it says.
- Write a dialogue between Kai and his mother, set in a memory-dream, where she teaches him not a specific fact, but a *way* of knowing.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a conceptual data structure for 'The Archive' that is inherently restrictive—how does it tag, sort, and limit the stories it holds? How would you hack it?
- Prototype a 'river code' interface: a system for navigating information not through folders or search, but through flow, tributaries, depth, and seasonal change.
